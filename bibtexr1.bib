  abstract  = {What determines what we see? In contrast to the traditional “modular” understanding of perception, according to which visual
processing is encapsulated from higher-level cognition, a tidal wave of recent research alleges that states such as beliefs, desires, emotions,
motivations, intentions, and linguistic representations exert direct, top-down influences on what we see. There is a growing consensus that
such effects are ubiquitous, and that the distinction between perception and cognition may itself be unsustainable. We argue otherwise:
None of these hundreds of studies – either individually or collectively – provides compelling evidence for true top-down effects on
perception, or “cognitive penetrability.” In particular, and despite their variety, we suggest that these studies all fall prey to only a
handful of pitfalls. And whereas abstract theoretical challenges have failed to resolve this debate in the past, our presentation of these
pitfalls is empirically anchored: In each case, we show not only how certain studies could be susceptible to the pitfall (in principle),
but also how several alleged top-down effects actually are explained by the pitfall (in practice). Moreover, these pitfalls are perfectly
general, with each applying to dozens of other top-down effects. We conclude by extracting the lessons provided by these pitfalls into
a checklist that future work could use to convincingly demonstrate top-down effects on visual perception. The discovery of
substantive top-down effects of cognition on perception would revolutionize our understanding of how the mind is organized; but
without addressing these pitfalls, no such empirical report will license such exciting conclusions.},

and multilevel models which are fit with the probabilistic programming language Stan behind the
scenes. Several response distributions are supported, of which all parameters (e.g., location, scale, and
shape) can be predicted. Non-linear relationships may be specified using non-linear predictor terms
or semi-parametric approaches such as splines or Gaussian processes. Multivariate models can be fit
as well. To make all of these modeling options possible in a multilevel framework, brms provides an
intuitive and powerful formula syntax, which extends the well known formula syntax of lme4. The
purpose of the present paper is to introduce this syntax in detail and to demonstrate its usefulness
with four examples, each showing relevant aspects of the syntax.},

The authors show that in several descriptive RT distributions, the standard deviation increases linearly with the mean. Results from a wide range of tasks from different experimental paradigms support a linear relation between RT mean and RT standard deviation. Both R. Ratcliff's (1978) diffusion model and G. D. Logan's (1988) instance theory of automatization provide explanations for this linear relation. The authors identify and discuss 3 specific boundary conditions for the linear law to hold. The law constrains RT models and supports the use of the coefficient of variation to (a) compare variability while controlling for differences in baseline speed of processing and (b) assess whether changes in performance with practice are due to quantitative speedup or qualitative reorganization.},

In this commentary, I focus on the second of these aims and assess how useful this approach is for exploring cognition. The approach is based on formulating statistical rather than substantive models on accuracy and RT. I focus here on the appropriateness of the RT component model. This RT model joins a family of recent statistical approaches to RT including those of Glickman, Gray, and Morales (in press); Peruggia, Van Zandt, and Chen (2002); Rouder, Lu, Speckman, Sun, and Jiang (in press); Schnipke and Scrams (1997); and Wenger and Gibson (2004). The advantage of these statistical rather than substantive models is robust estimation and sound inference when data are collected across disparate individuals and items. It is not hard to see how these statistical developments will lead to better substantive theory testing and development in cognitive psychology. Van Breukelen's model for the ith participant's RT to the j th item is given by:},
